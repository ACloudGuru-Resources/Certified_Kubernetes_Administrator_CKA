# Building a Kubernetes Cluster

# Lesson Reference

# First, upgrade the control plane node.
# Drain the control plane node.

kubectl drain k8s-control --ignore-daemonsets

# Upgrade kubeadm.

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.27.2-00
kubeadm version

# Plan the upgrade.

sudo kubeadm upgrade plan v1.27.2

# Upgrade the control plane components.

sudo kubeadm upgrade apply v1.27.2

# Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on the control plane node.

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.27.2-00 kubectl=1.27.2-00

# Restart kubelet.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# Uncordon the control plane node.

kubectl uncordon k8s-control

# Verify that the control plane is working.

kubectl get nodes
Upgrade the worker nodes.

# Note: In a real-world scenario, you should not perform upgrades on all worker nodes at the same time. Make sure enough nodes are available at any given time to provide uninterrupted service.

# Run the following on the control plane node to drain worker node 1:

kubectl drain k8s-worker1 --ignore-daemonsets --force

# Log in to the first worker node, then Upgrade kubeadm.

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.27.2-00

# Upgrade the kubelet configuration on the worker node.

sudo kubeadm upgrade node

# Upgrade kubelet and kubectl on the worker node.

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.27.2-00 kubectl=1.27.2-00

# Restart kubelet.

sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# From the control plane node, uncordon worker node 1.

kubectl uncordon k8s-worker1

# Repeat the upgrade process for worker node 2.
# From the control plane node, drain worker node 2.

kubectl drain k8s-worker2 --ignore-daemonsets --force

# On the second worker node, upgrade kubeadm.

sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubeadm=1.27.2-00

# Perform the upgrade on worker node 2.

sudo kubeadm upgrade node
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install -y --allow-change-held-packages kubelet=1.27.2-00 kubectl=1.27.2-00
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart kubelet

# From the control plane node, uncordon worker node 2.

kubectl uncordon k8s-worker2

# Verify that the cluster is upgraded and working.

kubectl get nodes
